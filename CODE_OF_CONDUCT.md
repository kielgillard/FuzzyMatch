# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be respectful, be constructive, assume good intent. We're here to build good software.

## Standards

**Expected:**
- Constructive feedback on code, not on people
- Accepting that there are multiple valid approaches to a problem
- Respecting that maintainers may decline changes that don't fit the project's direction

**Not acceptable:**
- Personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language
- Harassment in any form
- Publishing others' private information

## Enforcement

Violations can be reported to the project maintainers. Reports will be reviewed and result in a response deemed appropriate to the circumstances, up to and including a permanent ban from the project.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: issues, pull requests, and discussions.
